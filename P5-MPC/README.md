**Reflection of Model-Predictive-Control (MPC)**

The goal of this project is to implement Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track. Need to calculate errors of cte and Orientation Error epsi. Additionally, consider a 100 millisecond latency between actuations commands on top of the connection latency into your implementation.


* Implement MPC and visualize both your reference path and the MPC trajectory path during simulations 
* choose state, inputs, dynamics, constraints for IPOPT to optimize control errors
* manually tune parameters to let your car run safely and as fast as possible

**MPC model implementation**

1. state discussion

![][image1]
From Kinematic models which are simplifications of dynamic models that ignore tire forces, gravity, and mass, we can define the motion part of vehicles can be decided by px, py, psi and v.

However to keep my car always fit into trajactory of predicted path, I also need to consider cte and orientation error epsi.

2. actuators

The goal of Model Predictive Control is to optimize the control inputs: [δ,a], which stand for steer_value and throttle_value, meaning the actuators on angle and speed. An optimizer will tune these inputs until a low cost vector of control inputs is found. The length of this vector is determined by N as Number of Timesteps:

[δ1,a​1,δ2,a2,...,δN−1,aN−1]



Thus N determines the number of variables optimized by the MPC. This is also the major driver of computational cost.

MPC attempts to approximate a continuous reference trajectory by means of discrete paths between actuations. Larger values of dt result in less frequent actuations, which makes it harder to accurately approximate a continuous reference trajectory. This is sometimes called "discretization error".

A good approach to setting N, dt, and T is to first determine a reasonable range for T and then tune dt and N appropriately.

  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
